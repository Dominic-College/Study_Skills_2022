				When the Salesians first came here in 1946, the only buildings on our school site were the white house, known as Grantleigh, and some apple sheds.<br>

				There were 26 students in 1946 when the first Salesians arrived. Today we have 1,000 students and 130 staff. While the school has grown and expanded and continues to grow right now, with the building of the K-2 precinct, some things haven’t changed. We have always been and continue to be a tight knit community:<br> <h3> By Caylin Daley </h3>

				Schedule ahead - As you get homework you should write it down along with when it’s due or needs to be done by.<br>

				On an afternoon when you do your homework you should do the work that is due first before the rest. Ask a teacher if you are unsure and don't be shy to ask. Here is a template for a timetable <br>

				Always ensure your asking questions if you are ever confused or stuck with your assignments or classwork. You will not learn unless you understand the work that is given to you. <br>

			 <h2>Revise</h2>  <br>
		
			<section class="Revise">
				Before each test or after a class and you learn something new, revise over it so you can remember it. If it is a difficult topic or test, spend that extra bit longer so you feel more confident going into the test knowing you have had time to revise over what you have learnt in class. Use the helpful sources that your teachers put on SEQTA or save the worksheets and PowerPoints that are for each lesson so it is easier to find when you need them. You can use Quizlet to help you with flash cards or make your own. <br>
